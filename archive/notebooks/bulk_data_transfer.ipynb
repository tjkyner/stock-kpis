    "# Bulk Data Transfer\n",
    "The SEC offers a bulk data download option for all of the data in both the Frame and Company Facts APIs. This data is updated nightly and can be accessed at [http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/daily-index/xbrl/companyfacts.zip](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/daily-index/xbrl/companyfacts.zip). While all available data is provided (~14.5k files), only those companies in the S&P 500 are needed for this project. Due to the number of files that need to be selected and copied, it's necessary to create a script to automatically select the correct files.\n",
